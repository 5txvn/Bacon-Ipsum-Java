# **Bacon Ipsum Java** #
## *About* ##
Bacon Ipsum Java is a simple Java package that uses the Baon Ipsum API (https://baconipsum.com) to generate a *meatier* Lorem Ipsum
## *Usage* ##
If you would like, you can test the package right here in the repository using the Main.java file or you can even run this repository on Replit using the "run on repl.it" button. The classes and stuff is already generated and if you want to look at the base package file, you can find it inside the lib folder. To use the package with just the lib file, import the package using `import bacon.ipsum`, then create the ipsum object `ipsum baconipsum = new ipsum();`, and finally, use it however you want. For this example, we will just print the output to the console `System.out.println(baconipsum.generate());`. Enjoy!
